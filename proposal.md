### Outline

We plan to analyze Boston Marathon finish data for the years 2010, 2011 and 2013 in order to:

* Compare strata across years such as gender or age groups 
* Attempt to predict runners who drop out of the race based on increasing split times
* Perform a regression to predict finish time based only on 5k split, age and gender

### Completed So Far

* Set up team organization ([Trello board](https://trello.com/b/i6X6vm4s/statse139-group-project), [github repository](https://github.com/wihl/statse139-project))
* Secure data for the three years
* Decided on toolset (R Markdown)
* Performed initial regressions with log and polynomial transforms


### Remaining To Do

* add 1
* add 2
* Improve regressions by both transforms and attempting different regression models such as Random Forest
* Write up conclusions

### Challenges Faced

* add 1
* add 2
* Finish times are not linear with regards to split times, so some form of transformation will necessary
