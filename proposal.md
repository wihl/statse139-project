### Outline

We plan to do some form of regression or prediction of marathon finish times, perhaps specifically the Boston Marathon.

### Completed So Far

* Set up team organization (Trello board, github repository)
* Defined some potential data sources
* Discussion possible regression questions:
  * Predicting time based on split time
  * Predicting time based on previous half marathon
  * Predicting time based on environmental conditions


### Remaining To Do

* Collect data
* Decide tools (R Markdown, Jupyter, plain R)
* Try different regression models (linear, maybe Random Forest)
* Write up conclusions

### Challenges Faced

* Getting enough training data
* Getting sufficient half marathon data from runners
* Finish times are not linear with regards to split times, so some form of transformation will necessary
